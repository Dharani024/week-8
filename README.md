#Description
This eyes exercise uses html and CSS styles to create a set of eyes in the middle of the screen. There is code to track the user’s mouse input and to have the eyes follow wherever the user is pointing. This project’s focus was to work with styling and bootstrap as well as mouse and click events.

##How to run
Download all of the files to the same directory, making sure to keep the same file structure in place. Load the index.html file in a browser to start the program. The program will start and the eyes will move as soon as the file loads.

##Future Improvements
Future improvements could include having the eyes track the mouse independently since they are both calculating the same angle and therefore just off by a bit.
